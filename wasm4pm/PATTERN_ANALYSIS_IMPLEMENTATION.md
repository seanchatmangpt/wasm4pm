# Pattern Analysis Module Implementation — Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented dynamic YAWL pattern selection to replace the hardcoded `Sequence` pattern in the autonomic cycle. The system now analyzes trace structure and automatically selects the most appropriate pattern (Sequence, ParallelSplit, StructuredLoop, or ExclusiveChoice) based on quantitative characteristics.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Pattern Analysis Module

**File:** `wasm4pm/src/pattern_analysis.rs` (new file, 339 lines)

**Key Components:**

- **`TraceStructureAnalysis`**: Result struct containing selected pattern, confidence score, and detailed characteristics
- **`StructureCharacteristics`**: Quantitative metrics including:
  - Basic metrics: average trace length, unique activity count
  - Parallelism indicators: max out-degree, concurrency score
  - Loop indicators: rework score, has_repetitions flag
  - Choice indicators: branch points count, choice score

**Core Functions:**

1. **`analyze_trace_structure()`**: Main entry point that computes characteristics and selects pattern
2. **`detect_concurrency()`**: Identifies parallel execution paths by analyzing activity ordering across traces
3. **`detect_loops()`**: Detects repetitive activity patterns within traces
4. **`detect_choice_points()`**: Identifies decision points by finding activities with multiple unique successors
5. **`select_pattern()`**: Scores each pattern type and selects the highest-confidence match

**Algorithm Details:**

- **Concurrency Detection**: Counts pairs of activities that appear in both orders (A before B and B before A) across traces
- **Loop Detection**: Counts activities that repeat within the same trace
- **Choice Detection**: Identifies activities with multiple unique successors (corrected from original implementation)
- **Pattern Scoring**:
  - Sequence: concurrency < 0.2, no repetitions, choice < 0.3 → score 0.9
  - Parallel: uses concurrency score directly
  - Loop: uses rework score if repetitions exist
  - Choice: uses choice score directly

### 2. Integrated into Autonomic Cycle

**File:** `wasm4pm/src/lib.rs`

**Module Declaration:**

```rust
pub mod pattern_analysis;  // Line 115
```

**Pattern Analysis Layer (after Perception, line 535-586):**

```rust
// Extract traces as Vec<Vec<String>>
let traces_for_analysis: Vec<Vec<String>> = log.traces.iter()...

// Build activity frequencies HashMap
let mut activity_frequencies: HashMap<String, usize> = HashMap::new();
for trace in &log.traces { ... }

// Analyze trace structure
let pattern_analysis = pattern_analysis::analyze_trace_structure(
    &traces_for_analysis,
    &activity_frequencies,
)?;
```

**Dynamic Pattern Dispatch (line 662-692):**

```rust
// Use dynamic pattern instead of hardcoded Sequence
let pattern_ctx = pattern_dispatch::PatternContext {
    pattern_type: pattern_analysis.primary_pattern,  // DYNAMIC!
    ...
};

// Pattern name based on actual selected pattern
let pattern_name = if pattern_result.success {
    match pattern_analysis.primary_pattern {
        pattern_dispatch::PatternType::Sequence => "Sequence",
        pattern_dispatch::PatternType::ParallelSplit => "ParallelSplit",
        pattern_dispatch::PatternType::StructuredLoop => "StructuredLoop",
        pattern_dispatch::PatternType::ExclusiveChoice => "ExclusiveChoice",
        _ => "Unknown",
    }
} else {
    "Failed"
};
```

## Test Results

All 4 unit tests passing:

```
test pattern_analysis::tests::test_empty_traces ... ok
test pattern_analysis::tests::test_concurrency_detection ... ok
test pattern_analysis::tests::test_loop_detection ... ok
test pattern_analysis::tests::test_sequence_detection ... ok
```

**Test Coverage:**

- Sequence detection: Identical traces with no branching
- Loop detection: Traces with repeated activities
- Concurrency detection: Traces with activities in different orders
- Empty traces: Graceful handling of edge cases

## Bug Fixes

### Issue: Incorrect Choice Point Detection

**Problem:** Original implementation counted all outgoing edge occurrences, not unique successors. This caused identical sequential traces (A->B->C repeated 3 times) to be classified as having choice points.

**Fix:** Changed `detect_choice_points()` to use `HashSet<String>` to track unique successors per activity:

```rust
// Before: counted occurrences
let mut outgoing: HashMap<String, usize> = HashMap::new();
*outgoing.entry(trace[i].clone()).or_insert(0) += 1;

// After: track unique successors
let mut outgoing: HashMap<String, HashSet<String>> = HashMap::new();
outgoing.entry(trace[i].clone())
    .or_insert_with(HashSet::new)
    .insert(trace[i + 1].clone());
```

## Integration Points

1. **Perception Layer**: Extracts traces and activity frequencies from event log
2. **Pattern Analysis**: Computes quantitative characteristics and selects pattern
3. **Decision Layer**: Uses dynamically selected pattern for dispatch
4. **Telemetry**: Reports actual pattern name (not hardcoded "Sequence")

## Next Steps

The pattern analysis module is complete and integrated. The autonomic cycle now uses data-driven pattern selection instead of hardcoded assumptions. Future enhancements could include:

1. Add more pattern types (e.g., Multi-Merge, Synchronizing Merge)
2. Implement confidence thresholds for pattern selection
3. Add telemetry for pattern confidence scores
4. Optimize detection algorithms for large logs
5. Add integration tests with real event logs

## Files Modified

- `wasm4pm/src/pattern_analysis.rs` (created)
- `wasm4pm/src/lib.rs` (module declaration + integration)

## Time Taken

~90 minutes (within the 90-minute budget)

- Step 1 (60 min): Created pattern analysis module with detection algorithms
- Step 2 (30 min): Integrated into autonomic cycle with dynamic pattern dispatch
